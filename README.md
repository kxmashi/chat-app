# Full Stack Real-Time Chat Application with Authentication Using React JS and Firebase

Learning this project from the following YouTube tutorial:
[Full Stack Real-Time Chat Application with Authentication Using React JS and Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbocZlm71nE)

This is a full-stack real-time chat application built using **React JS** and **Firebase**. It allows users to sign up, log in, and communicate with each other in real-time. The app uses Firebase for authentication, Firestore for real-time database management, and Firebase hosting for deployment.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
